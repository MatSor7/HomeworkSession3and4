## Linear algebra in python

I used this homework as an opportunity to practice some linear algebra in python. The project shows how to define and print matrices, as well as a visualization of one property of a transposed and an inverse matrix.
The multiplication of matrices A and InverseA is rounded off because of an issue encountered with how python struggles with representing certain values when dealing with floating point values. The same would happen if the inverse matrix only had whole numbers for elements, as numpy interprets values from the inverse operation as floats and not integers.
