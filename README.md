## Linear algebra in python

I used this homework as an opportunity to practice some linear algebra in python. The project shows how to define and print matrices, as well as a visualization of one property of a transposed and an inverse matrix.
The multiplication of matrices A and InverseA is rounded off because of an issue encountered with how numpy struggles with representing certain values when.
